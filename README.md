# Dispatcharr Plugin Repository

> **This is a listing and distribution repository.** Plugin development, testing, and pre-releases should happen in your own repository. Submit a PR here only when your plugin is ready for public distribution.

A repository for publishing and distributing Dispatcharr Python plugins with automated validation and release management.

## How It Works

Each plugin lives in `plugins/<plugin-name>/` and must contain a valid `plugin.json`. When a PR is merged to `main`, plugins are automatically packaged and published to the [`releases` branch](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Plugins/tree/releases).

### PR Validation

Every PR runs automated validation that checks:

- Folder name is lowercase-kebab-case
- `plugin.json` is valid and contains required fields
- Version is incremented for existing plugins
- PR author is listed in `author` or `maintainers`
- `.github/` files are not modified by non-maintainers
- Python code is scanned by CodeQL (required check)

PRs where the author has no permission for any modified plugin are automatically closed with instructions.

Results are posted as a comment on the PR.

### Publishing

On merge to `main`, each plugin is:

- Packaged into a versioned ZIP (`plugin-name-1.0.0.zip`) and a latest ZIP (`plugin-name-latest.zip`)
- Given an MD5 checksum
- Listed in `manifest.json` with download URLs and metadata
- Only the 10 most recent versioned ZIPs are kept per plugin
